			Fit graphics on a page
			    Boris Veytsman

The fitbox package allows a box (usually an \includegraphics box) to
fit on the page.  It scales the box to the maximal allowed size within
the user-set limits. If there there is not enough space on the page,
the box is moved to the next one.


version 1.02 2019/02/20   Bug fixes
	     		  New command \fitbox* for boxes inside floats
			  New command \SetFitboxLayout for emulation of figsize
			  package functionality

version 1.01 2019/02/10   Use the width of the box around the graphics for
                          default max width.
			  Do not adjust user provided values even if they
			  seem nonsensical (but warn the user)
